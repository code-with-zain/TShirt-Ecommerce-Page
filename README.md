# TShirt-Ecommerce-Page
This is a simple T-shirt product page created by Zain Abid (Code with Zain). Users can view different T-shirt images, select their preferred size, and add items to the cart. JavaScript is used to change the main product image when smaller images are clicked. This project demonstrates basic e-commerce functionality.
